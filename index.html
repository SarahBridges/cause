<h1>Cause</h1>
<p>My cause is to ensure access to education for all.</p>
	<p>Education provides people with the necessary ingredients to imporve their lives.
	It would be impossible for to create a water system for a whole village if they did not 
	know how to do this. Providing access to education to countries where it is limited would
	allow people to help their own communities more than donations can from a distance. We've
	all heard the saying: "If you give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day, but if you teach a
	man to fish, he'll never go hungry."</p>
